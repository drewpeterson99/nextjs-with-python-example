# AI SDK Python Streaming Preview

This template demonstrates the usage of [Data Stream Protocol](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#data-stream-protocol) to stream chat completions from a Python endpoint ([FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)) and display them using the [useChat](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#chatbot) hook in your Next.js application.

## Deploy your own

## How to use

Run [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming-example
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming-example
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming ai-sdk-preview-python-streaming-example
```

To run the example locally you need to:

1. Sign up for accounts with the AI providers you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
2. Obtain API keys for each provider.
3. Set the required environment variables (such as AI provider API keys) in a new file called `.env.local`.
4. `npm install` to install the required Node dependencies that are listed in the `package.json` file.
5. `py -m venv .venv` to create a Python virtual environment.
6. `.venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment.
7. `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python dependencies.
8. `npm run dev` to launch the development server.
